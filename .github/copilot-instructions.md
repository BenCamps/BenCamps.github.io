## General Principles

- **Clean Code:** Prioritize **readability, maintainability, and reusability**.
- **Conciseness:** Aim for concise and expressive code.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, components, and files (e.g., `getUserProfile`, `ProductCard`, `useAuth`).
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract reusable logic into functions, custom hooks, or components.
- **Modularization:** Break down complex problems and features into smaller, manageable units (components, functions, utilities).
- **TypeScript First:** All new code should be written in **TypeScript**, leveraging its type safety features.
- **Testable Code:** Design code to be easily testable.
- **Package Management:** This project uses **yarn** for managing dependencies. All package installations and scripts should use `yarn` where appropriate.
- **Linting and Formatting:** Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting. Ensure all code adheres to the project's linting rules.

### General Guidelines

- **Co-locate logic that change together**
- **Group code by feature, not by type**
- **Separate UI, logic, and data fetching**
- **Typesafety across the whole stack â€“ db-server-client. If a type changes, everywhere using it should be aware.**
- **Clear product logic vs product infrastructure separation**
- **Design code such that it is easy to replace and delete**
- **Minimize places/number of changes to extend features**
- **Functions / APIs should do one thing well. One level of abstraction per function**
- **Minimize API interface and expose only what's necessary**
- **Favor pure functions, it makes logic easy to test**
- **Long, clear names over short, vague names, even at the cost of verbosity**

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## React Specific Guidelines

### Component Design

- **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer **functional components with React Hooks**. Avoid class components unless explicitly for error boundaries.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component should ideally have one primary responsibility. **Components should be kept small and focused.**
- **Component Naming:** Use `PascalCase` for all component names (e.g., `MyButton`, `UserAvatar`).
- **Props:**
  - Use `camelCase` for prop names.
  - Destructure props in the component's function signature.
  - Provide clear `interface` or `type` definitions for props in TypeScript.
- **Immutability:** Never mutate props or state directly. Always create new objects or arrays for updates.
- **Fragments:** Use `<>...</>` or `React.Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM wrapper elements.
- **Custom Hooks:** Extract reusable stateful logic into **custom hooks** (e.g., `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`).
- **UI Components:** Use [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/) for accessible, unstyled UI components when appropriate.


### State Management

- **Local State:** Use `useState` for component-level state.
- **Global State:** For global or shared state, prefer **React Context API**. Avoid prop drilling.

### Styling

- **Consistent Approach:** use Tailwind CSS v4 or later.
- **Scoped Styles:** Ensure styles are scoped to avoid global conflicts.

### Performance

- **Keys:** Always provide a unique and stable `key` prop when mapping over lists. Do not use array `index` as a key if the list can change.
- **Lazy Loading:** Suggest `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code splitting large components or routes.

## Next.js Specific Guidelines

### Data Fetching & Rendering

- **App Router Preference:** Use the **App Router** for new development.
- **Server Components:** Prioritize fetching data in **Server Components** (`async` components in `app` directory) for better performance and security. This is where a lot of the traditional memoization benefits are handled automatically.
- **Data Fetching Methods:**
  - For build-time data or rarely changing content, suggest `getStaticProps` (Pages Router) or direct `fetch` in Server Components with `revalidate` (App Router).
  - For dynamic, frequently changing data, suggest `getServerSideProps` (Pages Router) or direct `fetch` in Server Components (App Router).
  - Avoid client-side data fetching for initial page loads unless absolutely necessary (e.g., user-specific data after hydration).
- **Parallel Fetching:** When fetching multiple independent data sources, initiate requests in parallel.

### Routing

- **File-System Routing:** Use Next.js's App Route file-system convention.
- **Route Groups:** Utilize `(folderName)` to organize routes without affecting the URL path.
- **Dynamic Routes:** Define dynamic segments clearly (e.g., `[slug]`).
- **Middleware:** Suggest using `middleware.ts` for authentication, authorization, or other global request handling.

### Optimization

- **Image Optimization:** Always use `next/image` component for images.
- **Font Optimization:** Use `next/font` for optimizing fonts.
- **Dynamic Imports:** Use `next/dynamic` for lazy loading components to reduce initial bundle size.

### Project Structure

- **Colocation:** Colocate component files (JSX/TSX, CSS Modules, tests) within a feature folder.
- **Utility & Helper Modules:** **All general utility functions, helper functions, and large, non-component-specific logic should be extracted into a dedicated `lib/` folder.**
- **Private Folders:** Use underscore-prefixed folders (e.g., `_lib`, `_components`) for internal, non-route-related files.
- **No Barrel Files:** Do not use barrel files (e.g., `index.ts` that re-exports from other files) for module exports. Always import directly from the specific file to improve traceability and avoid circular dependencies.

### SEO & Accessibility

- **Metadata:** Use `generateMetadata` (App Router) or `next/head` (Pages Router) for SEO metadata.
- **Accessibility:** Emphasize semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.
