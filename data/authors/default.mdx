An avid tinker of all things. I love taking thing apart and figuring out how they work. During the work week I'm developing software. 
DotNet is my main work-hourse. I use it for mobile, desktop and web back-end development. 
I also use a bit of JavaScript. I like the simplicity of Jam stack development using static site generators to effeciantly deploy static html sites.
